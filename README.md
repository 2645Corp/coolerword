## About CoolerWord
With the develop code "coolerword", this project is designed to be a word-memorizing website. If possible, an English-learning website will it be!

## Why CoolerWord
So, why do we build coolerword? Since there are plenty of word-memorizing websites, for example,  [shanbay.com](http://www.shanbay.com/ "扇贝网"), [ileci.com](http://www.ileci.com/ "乐词"), [iwordnet.com](http://www.iwordnet.com/ "知米背单词"), [towords.com](http://www.towords.com/ "拓词"), [hujiang.com](http://cichang.hujiang.com/ "沪江英语开心词场"), [baicizhan.com](http://www.baicizhan.com/ "百词斩"), why would we still like to design our own project?
The reasons are as follows,

+ 1. Efficiency. 

Most of the word-memorizing websites existing are lack of efficiency. Many students, who have been applying such websites to their study, complained that these websites are far from sufficiently efficient. It turns out that completing a word book usually takes a lot of time. However, even with a great long time token, student still cannot recognize the words after used such website to help. 

Time is precious. And the lost time is never found again. Therefore, we hope that with our very efforts, we may help our users to enhance the efficiency to the extreme.

Admittedly, digital tools did make a big difference on helping increase the efficiency of memorizing words. But this does not mean they are perfect or they needn't be changed. There is still a lot of room for improvement.

Isn't there any efficient word-memorizing tool? There sure is. However, most of them are rather small and immature, which means they're not able to provide a convenient solution for their users. Despite a few users that could tolerate the inconvenience, most students don't use or even don't know these tools.

When it comes to conclusion, we know that it's our mission to develop a platform that is both efficient and convenient.

+ 2. Personalization.

Word-mem tools now are universally not able to be customized. Many platforms force you to follow the plan made by the system. For instance, you have to set how many words you learn in a day, you're not able to change this setting when you get started, you cannot clear the status of a word (unaware, learning, remembered) even the status is wrong (forgotten), etc. Some of these settings might be aimed at helping users to persist, but they obviously sacrificed the need of personalization.

And certainly, our project is designed to solve this problem.

## The Cooler Principles

+ 1. Persue Efficiency

Coolerword defines efficiency as to memorize words as fast as possible on the premise of memorizing firmly. As a word memorizing tool, we regard offering the most efficient solution of memorizing word as the first priority.

+ 2. User Centrality

Whereas many platforms attempt to be more user-friendly, coolerword has always been, and shall always remain user-centric. The tool is intended to fill the needs of those contributing to it, rather than trying to appeal to as many users as possible. It is targeted at the proficient learner, or anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude who is willing to read the documentation, and solve their own problems. Therefore, we do not consider helping users to keep studying or helping users to concentrate on their study. If you need such help, please move your steps to somewhere else.

+ 3. Pragmatism

CoolerWord cares a better using experience more than a better looking experience. Ultimately, design decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through developer consensus. Evidence-based technical analysis and debate are what matter, not politics or popular opinion.

+ 4. Free

All users are encouraged to participate and contribute to the project. Reporting and helping fix bugs is highly valued and patches improving packages or the core projects are very appreciated: Coolerword's developers are volunteers and active contributors will often find themselves becoming part of that team. Coolers can freely contribute packages to the Repository, improve the Wiki documentation, provide technical assistance to others or just exchange opinions in the forums, mailing lists.

And we sincerely welcome all students to use our project, share thoughts about learning and help improve our work. The project can get better with your effort!

This project is shared with a MIT license, which means it's not only free, but also open source. A commercial use of our project is also welcomed, since we all have the goal to make people learn better and more efficiently.
